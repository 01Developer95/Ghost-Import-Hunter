# Ghost Import Hunter v2.0 Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the v2.0 release of Ghost Import Hunter.

## 1. Core Engine Improvements

### 🧠 Deep Export Analysis (Parser-Based)
*   **Current Limit:** Uses naive Regex which fails on `export * from`, CommonJS, and complex re-exports.
*   **v2.0 Upgrade:** Switch to using the **TypeScript Compiler API** or **SWC** to correctly build a symbol table for every file. This will eliminate false positives with:
    *   Wildcard re-exports (`export * from './utils'`)
    *   CommonJS `module.exports` patterns
    *   Dynamic imports

### ⚡ Performance & Caching
*   **Async Processing:** Move from synchronous `fs` calls to fully asynchronous/parallel processing.
*   **Incremental Scans:** Cache scan results (hashes of files) to only re-scan changed files, significantly speeding up pre-commit hooks.

### 📦 Monorepo & Alias Support
*   **Problem:** Path aliases (e.g., `@components/Button`) and Workspaces often confuse the current resolver.
*   **v2.0 Upgrade:** First-class support for `tsconfig.json` `paths` and package managers (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun) workspaces.

## 2. New Features

### 🛠️ Auto-Fix (`--fix`)
*   Automatically remove unused imports.
*   Suggest removing "ghost" imports that don't exist.
*   (Optional) Attempt to install missing packages if they are available in the registry.

### 🙈 Granular Ignore System
*   Support for inline comments to ignore specific lines or files:
    ```typescript
    import { weirdThing } from 'legacy-lib'; // ghost-ignore-line
    ```
*   Support for `.ghostignore` file (git-ignore style).

### 🤖 Interactive Mode
*   Run `npx ghost-hunter --interactive` to walk through errors one-by-one and choose an action:
    *   [Delete Import]
    *   [Ignore]
    *   [Install Package]

## 3. Developer Experience (DX)

### ⚙️ Better Configuration (`ghost.config.js`)
*   Move beyond `.ghostrc` (JSON) to fully typed JavaScript/TypeScript configuration files.
*   Allow dynamic rules and exclusion logic.

### 📊 Enhanced Reporting
*   **JSON/SARIF Output:** Generate standard reports for easy integration with GitHub Actions (displaying errors right in the PR diff).
*   **HTML Reports:** Generate a visual dashboard of project health.

### 🔌 Plugin System
*   Allow community plugins to add custom checks (e.g., "Ban specific libraries" or "Enforce specific import styles").

## 4. Future Proofing

### 🐍 Multi-Language Architecture
*   Refactor the core loop to support plugins for other languages in the future (Python `requirements.txt`, Rust `Cargo.toml`).
